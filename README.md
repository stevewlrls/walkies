# Walkies!

This is a sample React SPA, bootstrapped using react-create-app.

It demonstrates component structuring and file organisation and includes a simulation of an asynchronous client/server API, showing how to use that in the context of React components.

As this is a demo project, authors have not been credited for image assets. Nevertheless, there are copying restrictions on some of the assets. (Do not publish for general use without appropriate accreditation!)

## Installing

As usual, to create a local copy first clone the repository and then execute `npm install`. This will use package.json to install the various project dependencies (including all of React and the React Router package).
